OPERA BUFR software sample programs
===================================


Installation
============

The following libraries are needed to build all the programs:

* zlib

* PNG 

* PROJ4; some graphical programs in the package, which are handling
  polar data, use a modified library, available here:
  http://www.knmi.nl/opera/odc/proj-4.4.9polar.tar.gz

* HDF5 (series 1.6.x or 1.8.x)

OPERA BUFR software 3.1 and OPERA BUFR tables up to 8 are included.

To install, go in directory bufr-opera-mf-XX
(XX is the release number), and run:
./configure --prefix=$HOME
make
(cd tests; make check)
make install

'make check' should give no errors. 'make install' will install
headers of the library in $HOME/include and the library libOperaBufr.a
in $HOME/lib.

News
====

This release is using OPERA BUFR 3.1, with a default BUFR edition
of 2, to ensure binary compatibility of the encoded messages with the
previous version.

HDF5 1.8.x is now supported.

Content (data samples)
======================
In directory 'tests', files:
* composite-ref.bfr (reflectivity composite message)
* cumul-ref.bfr (accumulation local message)
* local-ref.bfr (reflectivity local message)
* polar-ref.bfr (message in polar coordinates)
* wrwp-OMM-ref.bfr (WRWP message using the OPERA template)
* wrwp-opera-ref.bfr (WRWP message using the WMO template)
* antilles-CMO-ref.bfr (Caribbean composite message)

are BUFR messages for the formats given in "OPERA BUFR Guidelines" and
"New OPERA BUFR proposals" documents, using the WMO tables up to 14
and the OPERA tables up to 8.

* compo-cumul-ref.bfr (accumulation composite message)
  is a BUFR messages in the French internal BUFR format.

You can use the 'decbufr' included in the distribution to dump the
messages content (beware, some output files may be huge). For
polar-ref.bfr, no pixmap file is created so far. For cumul-ref.bfr
and compo-cumul-ref.bfr, a pixmap file is created, but it is forced to
8 bits integers. To correct that behaviour, a patch to rlenc.c will be
needed, in addition to the introduction of the new "special"
descriptor 3 21 200 for rainfall.

* odim-polar-ref.bfr is an ODIM polar data sample
* odim-compo-ref.bfr is an ODIM reflectivity composite. See details
  about that format at
  http://www.knmi.nl/opera/opera3/OPERA_2008_03_WP2.1a_InformationModel_UML_2.0.pdf
  and

Content (samples programs) 
==========================
To illustrate how to generate programmatically BUFR messages, I have
given some programs to do that in directory 'tests'.  The source files
are called build-*.c and are compiled for the tests (which are run
with the command 'make check').

The PROJ library is used to compute the 4 corner coordinates of the
images in some tests samples. If PROJ is not available, these tests
will fail.

For the curious, all the *-ref.bfr messages are actually conversions
from French real data, also in BUFR; so there are several localtab*85*
files in the directory 'tables' to decode that data.

And of course you should study build-*.c to learn how to avoid using
'decbufr' and 'encbufr' and so accelerate your radar
coding/decoding. 

Sample ODIM programs to convert from BUFR to HDF5 and vice versa are:
'bufr2hdf5' 'hdf2bufr' (polar data) and 'comp2hdf5' 'hdf2comp'
(composite). This is where the HDF5 library is needed.

Graphics
========
Directory 'view' has tools to build graphical PNG files from ODIM BUFR
files. The programs are 'bufr2view' (raw polar data viewing),
'bufr2view-cart' (viewing polar data in cartesian) and 'comp2view'
(composite viewing). They will compile and run only with the modified
PROJ library which adds a 'polar' projection; they needs the PNG
library of course.

When used with the '-k' flag, tools 'bufr2view-cart' and 'comp2view'
will create KML files, ready for use in Google Earth.
